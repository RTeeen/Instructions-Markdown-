Task 1 - Launch your "Xbox Game Bar" application

<br>
<br>
The first step to adding a new SSH key to your GitHub Account is checking to see if you have any exsiting SSH keys.
<br>
<br>

1. Open Command Line

2. Enter "ls -al ~/.ssh" to see if existing SSH keys are present (_This command lists the files in your .ssh directory, if they exist_)

 <br>

<br>

3. Check the directory output to see if you already have a public SSH key. The filenames of the public keys are one of the following:

- id_rsa.pub (_most common_)
- id_ecdsa.pub
- id_ed25519.pub

<br>

<br>

If you don't see an existing public and private key pair, then you can generate a new SSH key.

**Tip:**

<mark>If you receive an error that ~/.ssh doesn't exist, don't worry! We'll create it when we generate a new SSH key.
