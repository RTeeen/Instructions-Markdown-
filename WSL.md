### 1. Introduction
___

The Windows Subsystem for Linux allows us run a supported version of Linux in a windows environment. Although this would be a limited version of Linux and we won't be able to run any GUI interfaces such as Gnome or Xfce; it still supports all of the command line based apps such as MySQL, vim, Nano etc.

> 1.1 Is this for you?

If you are a Linux user who is just starting to use Windows or even a developer who needs to constantly go back and forth between a Mac and Windows device, having Linux installed on your system could help you do the command line tasks easier and faster.

> 1.2 Prerequisites

You need to have the following ready before proceeding to the installation process:

- Have Windows 10 installed
    - Update the windows for simplified installation (Optional)<br>
    - Update the windows for WSL 2 (Optional)

- Have access to admin privileges on Windows PowerShell and CMD.
- Access to Microsoft Store
- Access to internet


In the next section we will go over installing WSL.

### <span style="font-family: 'Helvetica', sans-serif;"> 2. SIMPLFIED VERSION </span>
___

> 2.1 Join the [Windows Insider Program](https://insider.windows.com/getting-started).

Linux Subsystem was originally created by Microsoft to run android apps on Windows. This project was shutdown and Microsoft imported this module as a feature for Windows 10. 

1. In order to install WSL via the simplified method, you need to signup for the Insider Program to access this feature. The signup process is well-explained in the [Microsoft's website](https://insider.windows.com/getting-started).

> 2.2 Your installed version of Windows 10 should be build 20262 or higher.

2. You can update your windows from Startup menu by searching "windows update" and clicking "check for updates" button.

>2.3 Enter the following command in your Terminal to begin the installation.

3. After the following requirements are in place, open the windows command prompt (CMD) with administrator privileges from the Startup menu .

4.
```
    wsl --install
```
* This command will automatically install Linux Ubuntu as the default distribution. If you want to install a different distribution, you can add a flag to the same command as following:
```
    wsl --install -d /Distribution Name/
```
5. Your WSL should be ready after the restart. Open the installed Linux app and it should finalize the setup automatically.

### 3. Install WSL on Windows 10 manually
___

Installing WSL manually should be done in this exact order to work.
Please note Installing WSL using this method could be done on any version of windows as it doesn't depend on the Beta testing Program and it will install WSL1 instead of WSL2 by default.

> 3.1 Enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux

1. To enable this module for windows we need to use the Windows PowerShell.
Search "powershell" in the Startup menu and run PowerShell as an administrator.

2. Enter the following command to enable Linux Subsystem on your device.
```
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart 
``` 
<br>

- **If you want to keep using WSL1, You can restart your computer now and jump to section 6, otherwise, go to next section to get the proper windows update based on your computer structure.**

> **3.2 Check requirements for running WSL 2**

In order to run WSL 2 you need to have a certain version of windows or higher based on your system architecture type.

3. To check your system type use the command prompt window from the last step and enter the following command:
```
    systeminfo | find "System Type"
```
4. Then you can check the version of your windows using the command below in the PowerShell:
```
    ver
```
Now according to the table below, check if your windows needs to be updated before switching to WSL2.

| System Type | Min Version  | Min Build   |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| X64         | Version 1903 | Build 18362 |
| ARM64       | Version 2004 | Build 19041 |

- **Please note builds lower than 18362 do not support WSL 2.**

> **3.3 Enable Virtual Machine feature**

5. Using the PowerShell window from the last steps, run the following command to enable the Windows Hyper V feature to run the Linux as a virtual machine.
```
    dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:VirtualMachinePlatform /all /norestart
```
6. After the installation is finished, restart your computer to complete the installation.

> **3.4 Download the Linux kernel update package**

7. Now based on your system structure on section 3.2, you need to download and install the compatible Linux kernel package update using the links below:

-[ x64 machines](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi)

-[ ARM64 machines](https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_arm64.msi)

8. After downloading the file, simply open the executable file and follow the wizard to complete the installation.

Now you can go ahead and set your WSL version to 2.<br><br>
> **3.5 Set WSL 2 as your default version**

9. Using the PowerShell window, execute the following command.

```
wsl --set-default-version 2
```

This command will set the default WSL version to 2 for every Linux system that you will install from now on.

> **3.6 Install your Linux distribution of choice**

Now your Windows is setup and ready to take in your new Linux OS as Sub-system running along with the Windows.

10. To download your Linux distribution navigate to [Microsoft Store](https://aka.ms/wslstore) and search for your desired Linux . I will be using Ubuntu in this example.

Here is a list of supported Linux systems:

- Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- openSUSE Leap 15.1
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP5
- SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1
- Kali Linux
- Debian GNU/Linux
- Fedora Remix for WSL
- Pengwin
- Pengwin Enterprise
- Alpine WSL

When you open your Linux for the first time, it might take a while to decompress all the packages and complete the installation but you just need to wait for this operation once.

11. After, it should ask you a username and password only for this particular Linux environment.
Enter the username and password for your Linux environment.

Your Linux should be up and running after the initializing.
