These instructions are on how to create a style guide from scratch using the online application Canva. This application makes creating imagery, design projects, style guides, and a wide range of projects needed by the design industry incredibly easy. It is used by front end developers, web designers, large and small businesses, freelancers and students because of its large range of content types and ability to quickly make graphical designs.
